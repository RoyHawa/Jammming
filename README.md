# Setup:

Head to the [Spotify developer dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) and log into your Spotify Account. Once logged in, you'll have the opportunity to "Create An App". You will find that you have a "Client ID".

Copy the client ID and place it in the clientID variable in src/util/Spotify.js(line 2).
